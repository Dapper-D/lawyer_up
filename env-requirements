# Environment Variables Requirements for Lawyer Up

## Required Environment Variables

1. REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY
   - Purpose: Authentication for Google's Gemini AI API
   - Required: Yes
   - Format: String
   - How to obtain: 
     1. Go to https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
     2. Create or sign in with your Google account
     3. Create a new API key

## Important Notes

- All environment variables must be prefixed with REACT_APP_ to be accessible in the React application
- Never commit actual API keys to the repository
- When deploying to Vercel, add these environment variables in the Vercel project settings
- For local development, create a .env file with these variables

## Security Considerations

- Keep your API keys secure and never share them
- Rotate keys periodically for better security
- Use different API keys for development and production environments
